/*
You are building a romantic Valentine’s Day React website using React.js and Tailwind CSS.

Requirements:

GENERAL
- Single-page React app
- Use functional components and hooks
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-friendly and centered layout
- Pink/red/romantic color theme
- Playful and cute tone (cartoon love vibe)

PAGE 1 (Proposal Page)
- Center everything vertically and horizontally
- At the top: a looping animated GIF showing two cute cartoon characters kissing
  - Surrounded by floating heart / love emojis
  - Hearts should gently float or pulse using CSS animation

- Below the GIF:
  Text (large, cute font):
  "Alice, will you be my valentine?"

- Below the text:
  Two buttons side by side:
  YES (green or pink)
  NO (red or gray)

NO BUTTON BEHAVIOR
- The NO button text should change every time it is clicked, cycling through phrases like:
  1. "NO"
  2. "Really sure??"
  3. "Pookie please 🥺"
  4. "Just think about it"
  5. "Don’t break my heart 💔"
  6. "Last chance 😭"
  - Continue looping through the messages

- Every time NO is clicked:
  - The YES button grows bigger using a scale transform
  - YES button growth should be smooth (CSS transition)
  - Eventually YES becomes so large it nearly fills the screen

YES BUTTON BEHAVIOR
- When YES is clicked:
  - Navigate to a second page or conditionally render a new screen

PAGE 2 (Success Page)
- Full-screen happy layout
- Big text:
  "Knew you would say yes! 💖"
- Below it:
  A looping GIF of cute cartoon characters hugging, cuddling, or expressing love
- Add subtle floating hearts or sparkles animation
- Background should feel warm and celebratory

TECHNICAL
- Use React useState for:
  - NO button message index
  - YES button scale
  - Page state (proposal vs success)
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Use inline styles only if necessary for dynamic scaling
- Add smooth transitions using Tailwind transition classes

ASSETS
- Use public GIF URLs (cute cartoon love / kissing / hugging)
- Keep everything lightweight and simple

Produce clean, readable, beginner-friendly React code.
